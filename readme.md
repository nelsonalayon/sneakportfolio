## Description

Sneak portofolio is a template that i applied my knoledge about javascript, css and html. I used objects like window.innerWidth, window.onload and window.onresize.


## problems solved

in this template it used fontawesome to use icons of social media and search, google fonts to use Montserrat and Questrial fonts.
this template is responsive with hamburguer menu implemented with javascript. When screen is less of 890px width, hamburguer menu appear. itÂ´s work due an mediaquery javascript:

``const ipad = window.matchMedia('screen and (max-width: 890px)')``

and with object.addEventListener detect user click to open mobile menu.

to make the image gallery, I used a technique called masonry layout that consists of making a gallery that fills all the spaces regardless of the height of the image. The code was taked from EDteam in youtube.

and to make hamburguer menu, i used code from Leonidas Esteban of platzi, in a course of responsive design.
